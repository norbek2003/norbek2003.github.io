	  <h2 class="card-title">Maintaining Stuyvesant's Spanish Civil War Project</h2>
	  <p class="card-text">
	     I had found David Hanna’s class stimulating and I was interested in the subject, so I
	     signed up for his new elective on the Spanish Civil War. It was a great class,
	     certainly one of the best I've taken. For those who don't know, the Spanish Civil War
	     was a curtain-raiser for World War II, a brutal conflict from 1936-1939, between the
	     democratically elected government and a far right wing coup backed by Hitler and
	     Mussolini. Thousands from around the globe went to Spain to serve in the International
	     Brigades against the assorted fascist forces. The American volunteers formed
	     the <i>Abraham Lincoln Brigade</i>.
	  </p>
	  <p class="card-text">
	     A key part of the course was that each student was assigned a volunteer from NYC to
	     research and write a paper on. This is where I came into the project. The Abraham
	     Lincoln Brigade had over 3000 volunteers. Luckily, there was a source with a full list
	     of their names along with some scant personal information. Since hand-checking each one
	     to figure out if they lived in NYC would be mind-numbingly time-consuming, I stepped
	     forward and offered to create a web-scraper. The web-scraper crawled through the
	     volunteers and their mini-biographies, scanning the texts for evidence that they had
	     lived in NYC by matching terms relating to it. I compiled the resulting information and
	     presented it to him.
	  </p>
	  <p class="card-text">
	    He also suspected that some of the volunteers had themselves gone to Stuyvesant High
	    School, so he asked me to check. Obtaining a list of the school’s students enrolled in
	    the appropriate years, I cross referenced it with the New Yorker volunteers’ list. And
	    indeed, there were some.
	  </p>
	  <p class="card-text">
	    
 The next step was to set up a website to display all the research
 projects. <a href="https://github.com/aortmannli">Angel</a> designed the website, and left me with
 a beautiful template to work off. After a lot of deliberation, we decided to host it through github
 pages. I created a backend GUI that would run locally in a browser, an intuitive control panel for
 seamlessly running the website, managing its content in a standardized manner, and handling the
 push to live.

	  <h2 class="card-title">Sudoku</h2>
	  <p class="card-text">

	    Taking <i>Introduction to CS</i> and liking the teacher, Peter Brooks, I decided to
	    audit his course on AI. It was a really fun class, so much so that I ended up officially
	    taking it the next term. Hands-down, one of the best projects was the Sudoku-solving
	    algorithm project. The challenge was to read a file containing an unsolved Sudoku
	    puzzle, and having your program output the solved version. I delved deep into this one,
	    it was tremendous fun. I perfected my algorithm, originally in Python, to be the best in
	    the class. While the other students were using brute force or even clever guessing, I
	    decided to take it a step further and implement Sudoku strategies. This uncovered
	    correct solutions to individual squares and allowed the algorithm to make better guesses
	    when absolutely needed, by shrinking the search field of possible values for a
	    square. With no false modesty, I must admit that my solver was the fastest and most
	    efficient in the class, solving any puzzle it confronted in 2 seconds at most, but
	    generally in fractions of a second.
	  </p>
	  <p class="card-text">
	    Though I enjoyed the class and the teacher, I decided to advance to the higher level CS
	    courses earlier than normal, after one instead of two terms. To do so, I had to create a
	    final term project for the higher level class to showcase my Java proficiency. Following
	    my sudoku solving algorithm, I decided to try my hand at redoing it in Java for my final
	    project. When I'd succeeded, I decided to add a GUI and some more features. The GUI
	    allowed users to generate a pseudorandom puzzle from a seed, input values into a blank
	    board and automatically solve it, undo and redo moves, as well as save and restore
	    games.
	  </p>
	  <p class="card-text">
	    Overboard? Possibly. Worth it? Definitely. I even ported the Java solving algorithm to
	    Netlogo for yet another project.

	  <h2 class="card-title">Chess</h2>
	  <p class="card-text">
	     I loved my Systems Level Programming class with JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver as the
	     teacher. Over a term I was able to become really acquainted with C, Linux, and low
	     level computing. For the final, we were challenged to create a project to showcase our
	     skills. I decided to create a chess game that works over networks, allowing people on
	     separate computers to play against each other. Originally, it was all terminal based,
	     albeit with colors. Since I had finished early, I decided to make a GUI. It may not be
	     the flashiest, but overall I'm quite comfortable with it. Features include: captured
	     piece displays, live and saveable move history, realtime gameplay with others, and,
	     dare I say, very stylish chess board and piece design.
